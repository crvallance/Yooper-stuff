# Colin's Houghton Area Stuff

## Houghton Area Food / Drink

* Armando's / Douglass House Saloon / [Doghouse](https://goo.gl/maps/juVCamWLUnf3sDD68)

  * Armando's is the restaurant (which is alright but I didn't really eat there much)
  * The Douglass House Saloon aka. "The Doghouse" was my bar in college and where I had my 21st. Great pickled eggs and free popcorn.

* [Ambassador](https://goo.gl/maps/MZHrHppM7DJ9miPC8)

  * The "ambo" has a cool bar/restaurant area with a neat mural. Pub style cracker crust pizzas, subs, and "fishbowls" to drink were usually dinner on Friday night.
  * Fishbowls come in many different kinds, though I think I was usually getting the standard long island or a scorpion.  Gone are the days where I could drink 2-3 of those *after* the first bar and before going to the next one.

* [Suomi](https://goo.gl/maps/rbz6HAqQJK7xGpUE8)

  * Houghton was a mining town and had lots of immigrants in those days. There are still lots of Finn and Sweede descendants in the area which is why pasties are a common thing. The [Suomi](https://www.facebook.com/Suomi-Restaurant-203042349717213/) has a fantastic breakfast where you can get giant cinnamon rolls, swedish pancakes, and more.

* [Keweenaw Co-op](https://goo.gl/maps/PKTGstsG39Z31xQo7)

  * Local food and produce for all us hippies. They've also got a deli and were pretty veggie friendly for the late 90s and early 00s.

* [Jim's food mart](https://goo.gl/maps/Vx93C7CambgSuuai7)

  * [Jim's](https://www.jimsfoodmart.com/shop/home) was the local grocery store across the street from my fraternity. Also shockingly veggie friendly for the time because our cook would get them to order early Morningstar products. Also a decent international section due to all the Indian students in the area. All around decent local grocery, beer, and liquor store.

* [Ming's](https://goo.gl/maps/cLAyXs97uDJZjRsu6)

  * Standard American style greasy Chinese food if that's what you're in the mood for.

* [Taco Bell](https://goo.gl/maps/HTXso6eLM33qjv816)

  * I cannot even begin to tell you how much Taco Bell I've consumed from this location. That is all...

* [KBC](https://goo.gl/maps/Dp9aTDDTLMuebHJK6)

  * The [Keweenaw Brewing Company](http://kbc.beer/) microbrewery started up my super-senior year. We used to get kegs for the same price as Busch light because they wanted to get their product out there. Good stuff and it's the spot to hit if you don't want standard Bud/Miller type products.

* [The Library](https://goo.gl/maps/SzwhaXgNqjdriGk6A)

  * This was the ["upscale"](https://www.thelibraryhoughton.com/) place we'd take our parents when they were in town to eat something better than dorm food. They have a little microbrewery there but the beers weren't ever that great.

* [Downtowner](https://goo.gl/maps/Pwdebz7RRULfPtuG6)

  * The "DT" has a nice deck overlooking the portage canal. Food and drink is pretty standard pub style stuff. We used to go there on Friday for their "Double Bubble" drink special where everything was two for the price of one. The bartender was (maybe still is?) a dude at another frat who sorta eased his way out of taking classes and in to full time bar tending. Needless to say his rum and coke's were ice, rum, and maybe a splash of coke for color.

* [Quincy's Restaurant & Lounge](https://goo.gl/maps/AnkzZ5hN89WcgjKw5)

  * Quintessential UP dining experience with rocks and a Moose. Not very veggie friendly so I didn't eat there often.

* [Roy's](https://royspasties.com/)

  * Can't say I've been here because I was always spoiled with home made pasties. Still, you need to have one while you're in the UP.

## General Area Houghton Items

* ["The" Walmart](https://goo.gl/maps/Lfw9WHHVrZ9eLXaK6)
  
  * The closest Walmart to this is almost 100 miles away so needless to say, this is a destination for a lot people within an hour or two. Savor it..

* [copper county mall](http://www.coppercountrymall.com/index.php)

  * Need a shitty movie theatre on a rainy day or an MC sporting goods? This is your place.

* [A.E. Seamen mineral museum](https://goo.gl/maps/KGVCYTwmMGZrd4pP9)

  * Go for [the rocks](http://museum.mtu.edu/), stay for the seamen

* [Portage lift bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/bR5UdRGMRxXeNQrx6)

  * You can walk across this (drunk if needed) to get a view of the canal and bridge

* [Mechanical Engineeringâ€“Engineering Mechanics Department](https://goo.gl/maps/mNpV7rUr4DA34Wzh9)

  * The "MEEM" AKA "The brick dick". Nothing exciting here, just fun to say.

* [Wadsworth Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/NwZGtkwMufQVSVJs5)

  * Once the largest non-miliary dorm in the US and is 1/4 mile long. Lived here from 99-00, ate shitty dorm food, and took lots of saunas in the basement.

* [Tech trails](https://www.michigantechrecreation.com/trails/index)

  * Just in case you need a trail run

* [MUB](https://goo.gl/maps/Fe746Th5CN5kx1sN6)

  * If you want any MTU collectables the [Memorial Union Building](https://www.mtu.edu/memorialunion/) is the place to go. Shitty food, bowling alley in the basement, and a book store where you can probably get a stuffed fuzzy husky.

* [Husky Plaza](https://goo.gl/maps/RjPRrcA47u29ju8w6)

  * Cool looking husky statue. See if you can find the memorial brick for Andy Mass from Gamma Rho.

* [University Suites apartment building](https://goo.gl/maps/CTffUskuQjXd5ipA9)

  * Formerly the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity house. We built this place after the original house burned down. Unfortunately ambition was a bit high and subsequent brothers weren't able to keep enough people paying rent to keep up with the mortgage. Lived here and next door for a couple years.

## Houghton Area Outdoor Activities

## Copper Harbor

* [Brockway Lookout](https://goo.gl/maps/wvbcxqQb7HXGEMHq6)

  * Nice lookout that's incredible if you can catch it at sundown. Only downside is the 40 min drive back to Houghton in the dark with wildlife who love to be in the road.

* [Lac La Bell](https://goo.gl/maps/Ww94UTAJZmsgyESp7)

  * Lighthouse, inland lake, and Mt. Bohemia that has hiking, biking, etc.

  * The beginning of [Highway 41](https://goo.gl/maps/24eqysPXScdKbEFM9)
    * Yes, the same 41 that comes through Chicago (Lincoln/Foster/LSD)
  * We stopped at [Lake Effect Bar and Grill](https://goo.gl/maps/Tt238pGGsDGFkPDT6) for a drink and a snack last time.

* [Gay Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/ktmNZcNLCmGYVMW1A)

  * The [bar in Gay, MI](https://thegaybar.com/) that I would not qualify as an actual gay bar. Borders on offensive with gems like [this](https://thegaybar.com/product/seating-for-four-at-the-gar-bar/) and [this](https://thegaybar.com/product/the-gay-bar-hello-t-shirt/). Seems right up John's alley.
